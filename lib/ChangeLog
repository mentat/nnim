[Old changelog for the old codebase - will be removed shortly]

14/2/99
Started the changelog...
-Henrik

18/2/99
Changed the code to call my wrappers for most systemdependant stuff, and implemented (somewhat simplified) the wrappers for threads, dynamic object loading and socket functions.
-Henrik

20/2/99
Wrote some plugin loading code. The idea is that the server should load all 
shared objects in [a direcory] as plugins. Plugins should be able to replace or extend any major module in the server. 
-Henrik

21/2/99
Made packet queues a lot more customizeable (in my continuing quest to make the
server better). You can now register any number of handlers for a queue, and they will each be called with the queue data. (perfect for making encryption plugins). Also made it possible to register new commands and threads.
-Henrik

22/2/99
Linked with Electric Fence, in a effort to get rid of some malloc() related bugs
.. *phew* there were lots of them. I know a couple of potentioally devestating 
bufer overflows in the command handler.. gotta fix em.
-Henrik

28/2/99
Added md5 code, started a checksum checking routine on incoming packets.
Wrote plugin documentation..
-Henrik

1/3/99 
Implemented some Win32 versions of socket routines, added more checks to
make sure a incoming packet is a valid KiT packet.
-Henrik

26/3/99
Cleaned up the code, added suport for the notification of the arrival of message
Released version 0.0.6
