There are a lot of people that have directly or indirectly helped me with 
developing KiT, here is an (incomplete) list of people that i'd especially
like to thank.

The Apache Group: I stole some code from their Apache server for DLL loading.
DrDevil in #tpu on efnet: Thanks for helping me get started again. :)
rnd in #tpu: For writing an early version of the config file loader.
