       Version 0.01

OVERVIEW:
-----------------------------------
Installation of the KiT server is not overly complex. All you need to do is 
to create the MySQL database tables, and edit the config file.


DATABASE:
----------------------------------
In order to use KiT, the server needs to store its data somewhere. We've 
chosen to use MySQL as our database, but it will be possible to write a 
plugin to handle any database.

Now, for mysql you need to:
	* Create a database
        * Create a user and set a password
        * Create the database tables.
        * Change the kitd.cfg file to include the right values.
        
Of course, you can use any existing user and database too.
For full instructions on adding a user, please see section 6.11 
in the mysql reference manual. However, you probably need to do
something like this: (Replace everything in [ ] with real values)


bash# mysql --user=root mysql 
mysql> CREATE DATABASE kit;   
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kit.* TO [kituser]@localhost 
                                 IDENTIFIED BY '[password]';
mysql> quit

bash# mysql --user=[kituser] kit -p
Enter Password: [password]
mysql>

Good, take took care of points one and two on the list above. Now, you need 
to write this into the mysql prompt. Please be careful, and check that you 
spelled everything correctly.

** BEGIN TABLES **



** END TABLES **

KiT is known to work with mysql version 3.22.26a.

CONFIG FILE:
-----------------------------------

!!!!!!!!!!! Outdated info !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!
!! this rewrite of the server doesnt have config file support yet.
!! hack the code if you wish to change anything. (new config file will
!! be XML but will support mostly these options - thats why i kept it)
!!
!!
!!!!!!!!!!! dont look below this :) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The options look like [name] = [value];. For reasonable defaults, look
at the sample config file included. 

OPTION: port:

The port the server should listen for. (4444 default)


OPTION: admin:

Info about the administrator of the server.


OPTION: loglevel:
	debug:
        
Debug specifies if debugging should be turned on or not, if on, the server
will output a whole bunch of incomprehensible output. Be sure to include
a debug log when reporting bugs The loglevel switch determines how much 
info the server should output.
loglevel ranges from 0 (nothing except fatal) to 10 (ridiculous amount)
NOTE: If debug = on then the server will output _everything_, regardless
of loglevel setting.


OPTION: plugindir:

A Directory where all the plugins for the server is located. 


OPTION: plugin: (disabled)

Specifies which plugins to load - a comma separated list of filenames;
Due to some stability problems, the plugins are currenty disabled.

OPTION: database (disabled)

a shared library that sits between the client and server. Due to some 
stability problems, the plugins are currenty disabled.


OPTION: db user:
	db passwd:
	db host:

Specifies the user name, password and host the KiT server should use to 
connect to the SQL server.


OPTION max queue len: (default 100)

Decides how "deep" the various internal queues should be. The packets waiting
to be processed and sent are stored in these queues, and the longer they 
are the higher burst loads the server can handle without getting bogged down
Experiment with different settings and see how they affect performance. 
Should probably be increased for heavy loads.
 
 
OPTION: rsa public:
	rsa private:
        
The files where the rsa keys are located.

RSA KEYS
---------------

To generate the RSA keys, go to the keygen/ subdir and run the kitkeygen
utility.
