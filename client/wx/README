GM: NNIM 
The wxWindows client for the GNU Messenger Project


Visual C++ Notes:

This project was created with Visual C++ 6 sp5.

The project assumes that your wxWindows install is
located on the same drive as the VC project in:
/cvs/wxWindows
If this is not the case you will need to modify
the settings for "C++"->"Preprocessor" 
and "Link"->"Input" and "Resources"->"Additional Include"

The project also assumes that CryptoPP is one level
below the GM ( gm/src/ ) directory in the directory:
cryptopp/src/

A build of libGM is required to build the wxgui
project.
